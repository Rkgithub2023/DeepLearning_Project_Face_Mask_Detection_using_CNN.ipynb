# Deep Learning:Face Mask Detection Using CNN

## Project Description

This project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 🧠 to accurately detect whether individuals are wearing face masks 😷. It is built using a custom neural network architecture, including several convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, to effectively learn and classify mask usage from images 🖼️. 

The primary goal is to support health and safety measures by providing a reliable mask detection tool. The system can be integrated into security and monitoring applications, such as public space surveillance and access control systems, ensuring compliance with mask-wearing protocols. With real-time detection 🎥 capabilities, it offers immediate feedback, making it ideal for live scenarios. Performance is evaluated through various metrics 📈, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, to ensure the model's effectiveness and reliability across different environments.

- **Image Classification** 🏷️: The model classifies images into two categories—"Mask" and "No Mask"—to ensure compliance with mask-wearing guidelines. This feature is useful for applications in security and public health monitoring.
- **Real-time Detection** 🎥: Implements real-time face mask detection using a webcam feed, providing immediate feedback and alerts. This feature is ideal for integration into live monitoring systems or access control applications.
- **Performance Metrics** 📈: Evaluates model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics help in understanding the model's effectiveness and reliability in various scenarios.

This project aims to support public health initiatives by providing a reliable tool for mask detection, thereby contributing to safer environments and improved compliance with health protocols.
